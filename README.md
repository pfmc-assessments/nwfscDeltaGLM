Description
=============

nwfscDeltaGLM
* Is an R package for implementing a Bayesian stratified delta-GLMM for use when standardizing fishery-independent index data for U.S. West Coast surveys.
* Has built in diagnostic functions and model-comparison tools
* Is intended to improve analysis speed, replicability, peer-review, and interpretation of index standardization methods


Instructions
=============

First, please install JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) here: http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/

Next, please use R version >=3.1.1 and install the package:

    # Install package
    install.packages("pak")
    # Current releases can be installed with
    pak::pkg_install("pfmc-assessments/nwfscDeltaGLM")
    library(nwfscDeltaGLM) 

Please see vignettes folder (i.e., https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/nwfscDeltaGLM/blob/master/vignettes/example.Rmd) for an example of how to run the model. Or https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/nwfscDeltaGLM/blob/master/vignettes/simulation_example.Rmd for an example of how to simulate and fit some different data structures. 

Known installation/usage issues
=============
Please read the following list of known problems and solutions
* Users sometimes have trouble loading the package, with R throwing an error about package "rjags".  Please reinstall the latest version of JAGS and then re-install nwfscDeltaGLM
