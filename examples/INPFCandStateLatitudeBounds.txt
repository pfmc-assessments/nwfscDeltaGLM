West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey Database
INPFC and U.S. State Definitions by latitude

Extracted: 10/1/2012

Note that the border between Washington and Oregon is some value between 46.25 and 46.3 degrees North Latitude (probably 46.3).  Because our finest grid of areas is limited to half degree increments, it was decided that 46.0 degrees better represented the species density patterns than would 46.5 degrees as proxy for the true border.
